# Similar Projects

Several similar projects have been made throughout the years doing the same thing as Reaparr does. Especially [Saverr](https://github.com/ninthwalker/saverr) was a great inspiration and showed the methods Reaparr also uses.

## [Saverr](https://github.com/ninthwalker/saverr)

A PowerShell script with a front-end GUI to download media from Plex servers. Allows you to search and save movies, TV shows, and music for offline/personal use.

## [plexmedia-downloader](https://github.com/codedninja/plexmedia-downloader)

A Python script that accepts your username, password, and a URL to media you have access to, then downloads it to your local machine.
