# Installation on Docker

This guide shows how to run Reaparr with Docker on any OS (Linux, Windows, macOS).

## Prerequisites
 - Have Docker installed on your system. The guides assume you already have Docker set up.

---

## 1) Create data directories on the host

You need these directories on your host. They will be mounted into the container:
- `/Config` – Configuration, logs, and database (SSD recommended)
- `/Downloads` – Temporary storage during downloads
- `/Movies` – Default movies destination folder
- `/TvShows` – Default TV-show destination folder

Example (home directory) on Linux/macOS:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Reaparr/Config ~/Reaparr/Downloads ~/Reaparr/Movies ~/Reaparr/TvShows
```

## 2) Find your user’s PUID and PGID

Run this command in a terminal to find your user’s UID and GID:
```bash
id
```

Example output:
```
uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) ...
```
- `uid=1000` → `PUID=1000`
- `gid=1000` → `PGID=1000`

More info: https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/understanding-puid-and-pgid/

## 3) Run Reaparr with Docker

### Option A: docker run

Customize paths, timezone, and IDs to match your system:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name Reaparr \
  -p 7000:7000 \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=America/New_York \
  -v <ADD_FOLDER_PATH>/Config:/Config \
  -v <ADD_FOLDER_PATH>/Downloads:/Downloads \
  -v <ADD_FOLDER_PATH>/Movies:/Movies \
  -v <ADD_FOLDER_PATH>/TvShows:/TvShows \
  reaparr/reaparr:latest
```

### Option B: Docker Compose

Reference compose file: [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Reaparr/Reaparr/blob/dev/docker/docker-compose.yml)

Download the example to `~/Reaparr`:

```bash
curl -o ~/Reaparr/docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reaparr/Reaparr/refs/heads/dev/docker/docker-compose.yml
```

Adjust values as needed (paths, `PUID`, `PGID`, `TZ`):

```yaml
version: '3.4'
services:
  reaparr:
    container_name: Reaparr
    image: reaparr/reaparr:latest
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
    ports:
      # Web UI & Web API
      - '7000:7000'
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - UNMASKED=false # Unmask sensitive data in logs if true
      # - LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG # Set the logging level in the docker logging
    volumes:
      # Example host paths – replace with valid writable locations on your machine
      - /mnt/PROJECTS/ReaparrCache/Config:/Config
      - /mnt/PROJECTS/ReaparrCache/Downloads:/Downloads
      - /mnt/PROJECTS/ReaparrCache/Movies:/Movies
      - /mnt/PROJECTS/ReaparrCache/TvShows:/TvShows
```

Bring it up:

```bash
docker-compose -f ~/Reaparr/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

---

## 4) Verify and access

Check the container:
```bash
docker ps
```

## 5) Done!

## Troubleshooting

- Docker command not found or fails to start: ensure Docker is installed and the service/daemon is running
- Cannot access Reaparr Web UI:
  - Verify the container is running (`docker ps`)
  - Check firewall rules for port `7000`
  - Try a different browser
- Permission errors (e.g., UnauthorizedAccessException on `/Config/ReaparrSettings.json`):
  - Ensure `PUID` and `PGID` match your user
  - Ensure your user has write permission for the mounted host folders
