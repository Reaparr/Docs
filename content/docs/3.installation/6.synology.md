# Installation on Synology

::ai-generated-alert

This guide walks through running Reaparr on Synology DSM via the built‑in Container Manager (DSM 7.x) or the legacy Docker package UI. It mirrors the Docker guide: same image, ports, volumes, and environment variables.

---

## Prerequisites

- DSM 7.x with Container Manager installed (Package Center → Container Manager)
- An admin-capable account on your NAS
- Shared folders created for Reaparr data (see below)
- Optional but recommended: SSH enabled to find your PUID/PGID

---

## 1) Create shared folders on your NAS

Create folders that will be mounted into the container. Example layout (adjust to your setup):

- `/volume1/docker/reaparr/Config` – Configuration, logs, database (SSD recommended)
- `/volume1/docker/reaparr/Downloads` – Temporary storage during downloads
- `/volume1/media/Movies` – Final movies library
- `/volume1/media/TvShows` – Final TV library

Grant your NAS user (the one running containers) Read/Write permission to these folders:

Control Panel → Shared Folder → select each folder → Edit → Permissions → give your user “Read/Write” (apply to this folder, sub‑folders, files).

---

## 2) Find your PUID and PGID (Synology)

From an SSH session to your NAS (Control Panel → Terminal & SNMP → enable SSH):

```bash
id <your-nas-username>
```

Example output:
```
uid=1026(myuser) gid=100(users) ...
```
- `uid=1026` → `PUID=1026`
- `gid=100` → `PGID=100`

Use your actual values; they vary per NAS/user.

---

## 3) Option A — Container Manager UI (DSM 7.2+)

1. Open Container Manager.
2. Go to “Image” → Search for `reaparr/reaparr` → Download tag `latest` (or `dev` for the development build).
3. Go to “Container” → Create → select the `reaparr/reaparr` image.
4. General:
   - Name: `Reaparr`
   - Restart policy: “Unless stopped”
5. Ports:
   - Local port `7000` → Container port `7000` (TCP)
6. Environment:
   - `PUID=<your uid>`
   - `PGID=<your gid>`
   - `TZ=<Your/Timezone>` (e.g., `Europe/London`)
   - Optional: `UNMASKED=false` (leave false unless you need unmasked logs)
   - Optional: `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for verbose logging
7. Volumes (Mounts):
   - `/volume1/docker/reaparr/Config` → `/Config`
   - `/volume1/docker/reaparr/Downloads` → `/Downloads`
   - `/volume1/media/Movies` → `/Movies`
   - `/volume1/media/TvShows` → `/TvShows`
8. Apply and start the container.
9. Access Reaparr at: `http://<NAS-IP>:7000` (or `http://<nas-hostname>:7000`).

### DSM 7.0/7.1 (Legacy “Docker” UI)

- Package Center → Docker → Registry → search `reaparr/reaparr` → Download.
- Go to “Image” → Launch → configure the same Ports, Environment, and Volume mappings as above → Apply → Start.

---

## 4) Option B — Projects (Docker Compose) in Container Manager

If your Container Manager supports “Projects” (Compose):

1. Container Manager → Projects → Create.
2. Choose “Create from Compose file” and paste the following (adjust paths, `PUID`, `PGID`, `TZ`):

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  reaparr:
    container_name: Reaparr
    image: reaparr/reaparr:latest
    ports:
      - "7000:7000"
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - PUID=1026        # replace with your uid
      - PGID=100         # replace with your gid
      - TZ=Europe/London # replace with your timezone
      # - UNMASKED=false  # optional
      # - LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG # optional
    volumes:
      - /volume1/docker/reaparr/Config:/Config
      - /volume1/docker/reaparr/Downloads:/Downloads
      - /volume1/media/Movies:/Movies
      - /volume1/media/TvShows:/TvShows
```

3. Deploy the project. Access the app at `http://<NAS-IP>:7000`.

---

## 5) Verify and access

- Check container status in Container Manager → Container.
- Open `http://<NAS-IP>:7000` in your browser.
- If prompted for setup, complete the initial configuration.

---

## 6) Permissions and common fixes

- Permission denied writing to `/Config`, `/Downloads`, `/Movies`, or `/TvShows`:
  - Ensure your NAS user has Read/Write on the mapped shared folders.
  - Ensure `PUID`/`PGID` match that NAS user’s `uid`/`gid`.
  - Avoid mapping to read-only shared folders.
- Port 7000 already in use: change the local (host) port to an available one (e.g., `7001:7000`).
- Container won’t start or exits: check logs in Container Manager (View Logs) for hints.

Note: As a last resort, you can loosen permissions temporarily from within the container (not recommended long‑term):

```bash
chmod -R 777 /Config /Downloads /Movies /TvShows
```

Prefer fixing NAS shared folder ACLs and correct `PUID`/`PGID` instead of permanent `777`.

---

## 7) Optional: Reverse Proxy on Synology

Use Control Panel → Login Portal → Reverse Proxy to expose Reaparr behind HTTPS (DSM’s built‑in Nginx):

- Create a new rule:
  - Source: `reaparr.yourdomain.com`, Port `443` (with a valid certificate via Control Panel → Security → Certificate)
  - Destination: `127.0.0.1`, Port `7000`
- Save and apply. Then access `https://reaparr.yourdomain.com`.
