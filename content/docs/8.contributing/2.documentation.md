## Editing a Page

Every page has an **Edit this page** link at the bottom. Clicking it will take you directly to the file on GitHub.

From there:

1. Click the pencil (edit) icon to fork the repository and edit the file
2. Make your changes in the Markdown editor
3. Submit a pull request with a short description of what you changed

That's it — no cloning or local environment needed.

You're also free to create an issue on GitHub if you want to suggest changes without editing the content yourself.
