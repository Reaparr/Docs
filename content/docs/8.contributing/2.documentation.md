## Editing a Page

Every page has an **Edit this page** link at the bottom. Clicking it will take you directly to the file on GitHub.

From there:

1. Make your changes in the Markdown editor
2. When done, click on "Commit Changes" at the top right of the page
3. Add a descriptive commit message about what you changed
4. Scroll down and ensure the "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" option is selected
   - The branch name will be automatically generated based on your commit message, but you can change it if you want
5. Submit the pull request

That's it — no cloning or local environment needed.

You're also free to create an issue on GitHub if you want to suggest changes without editing the content yourself.
