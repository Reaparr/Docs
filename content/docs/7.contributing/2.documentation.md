# Documentation

Contributing to the documentation is straightforward and doesn't require any local setup.

## Editing a Page

Every page has an **Edit this page** link at the bottom. Clicking it will take you directly to the file on GitHub.

From there:

1. Click the pencil (edit) icon to fork the repository and edit the file
2. Make your changes in the Markdown editor
3. Submit a pull request with a short description of what you changed

That's it — no cloning or local environment needed.

## Running Locally

If you want to preview your changes locally before submitting:

1. Clone your fork
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:4000 in your browser

## Writing Content

Documentation pages are written in Markdown and live in the `content/docs` directory. Refer to the [Nuxt Content docs](https://content.nuxt.com) for supported syntax and components.
