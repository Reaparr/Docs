## Sonarr/Radarr Integration

Reaparr can fully integrate with **Sonarr** and **Radarr** by pretending to be both a **Torznab indexer** and a **qBittorrent download client**.
This lets Sonarr/Radarr communicate with Reaparr as if it were a standard setup — no code changes or special configuration needed on their side.

**How it works**

* Reaparr acts as a Torznab-compatible **Indexer**, returning fake torrent files.
* These fake torrents are then sent to Reaparr’s built-in **Download Client**, which handles downloading and tracking.
* Sonarr/Radarr see Reaparr’s download progress and can import completed files to their target folders normally.
* [FUTURE] Reaparr can also provide an **RSS feed**, so Sonarr/Radarr automatically grab new or wanted releases.

**Limitations**

* The fake torrent files are **not compatible with real torrent clients** — only Reaparr can process them.

**Automation**

* Because Sonarr and Radarr expose APIs, Reaparr can **auto-configure itself** in those apps with a single click, making setup almost automatic.

Future versions will extend this to **Lidarr** once music support is added.
